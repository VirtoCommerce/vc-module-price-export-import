### Business scenarios* I need to export two pricelists to make comparing. 
* I need to change multiple prices in the price list of few hundreds of records in the price list of thousands of records.
* I need to make a bulk price update (+5% for everything) for a price list of thousands of records.
* I need to add prices for a batch of new products added to the catalog.

## Development
The C# interfaces and implementation can be changed in next releases.
