# Overview
If you want to transfer a large amount of price information between Virto Commerce and another system,
then you can use a specially-formatted spreadsheet to import or export that data. Virto Commerce uses CSV (semicolon-separated value) files to perform this kind of bulk task.

The business goal for the module is to provide to non-technical not high skilled business users (like "category manager") who works with prices on a daily basis and don't understand the database structure to work comfortably with prices export and import functionality using it for price management.

    If you want to automated transferring information from 3rd party system, like ERP, then see API, Integration Middleware approach and Azure Logic Apps connectors.


## Business scenarios
* I need to export two price lists to make comparing. 
* I need to change multiple prices in the price list of few hundreds of records in the price list.
* I need to make a bulk price update (+5% for everything) for a price list.
* I need to add prices for a batch of new products added to the catalog.

## Using CSV

### Get a sample CSV file
You can export and view a sample priceline CSV file to use as a template.

The sample file includes many columns but for import only the SKU column, min quantity and prices will be used, other columns will be skipped

### Priceline CSV file format for import
The first line should be Header: `SKU`;`List price`;`Sale price`;`Min quantity`. Each column must be separated by a semicolon. Product SKU, Min quantity and List price values are required for creation and updating prices. Priceline KEY - the pair SKU + min quantity, so it should not be duplicated in CSV file. Where SKU = product Item code and Min quantity = minimum product quantity needed for specifided price

 Example:

 ![csv file](media/Screenshot_9.png)

SKU | List price | Sale price | Min quantity 
---| --- | --- |
54FT67 | 20 | 19 | 1
41MY54 | 22 | 20 | 2
