If you want to transfer a large amount of price information between Virto Commerce and another system,
then you can use a specially-formatted spreadsheet to import or export that data. Virto Commerce uses CSV (comma-separated value) files to perform this kind of bulk task.


The business goal for the module is to provide to non-technical not high skilled business users (like "category manager") who works with prices on a daily basis and don't understand the database structure to work comfortably with prices export and import functionality using it for price management.

### Business scenarios
* I need to export prices from two pricelists to make comparing. 
* I need to change multiple prices in the price list of few hundreds of records in the price list of thousands of records.
* I need to make a bulk price update (+5% for everything) for a price list of thousands of records.
* I need to add prices for a batch of new products added to the catalog.
