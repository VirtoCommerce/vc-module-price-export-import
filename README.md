If you want to transfer a large amount of price information between Virto Commerce and another system,
then you can use a specially-formatted spreadsheet to import or export that data. Virto Commerce uses CSV (semicolon-separated value) files to perform this kind of bulk task.

The business goal for the module is to provide to non-technical not high skilled business users (like "category manager") who works with prices on a daily basis and don't understand the database structure to work comfortably with prices export and import functionality using it for price management.

### Note
If you want to automated transferring information from 3rd party system, like ERP, then see API, Integration Middleware approach and Azure Logic Apps connectors.

## Business scenarios
* I need to export two price lists to make comparing.
* I need to change multiple prices in the price list of few hundreds of records in the price list.
* I need to make a bulk price update (+5% for everything) for a price list.
* I need to add prices for a batch of new products added to the catalog.
